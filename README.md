# Content
Data set containing 15.010 observations and more than 6.000 transactions from a bakery. The data set contains the following columns:

*  Date. Categorical variable that tells us the date of the transactions (YYYY-MM-DD format). The column includes dates from 30/10/2016 to 09/04/2017.

*  Time. Categorical variable that tells us the time of the transactions (HH:MM:SS format).

*  Transaction. Quantitative variable that allows us to differentiate the transactions. The rows that share the same value in this field belong to the same transaction, that's why the data set has less transactions than observations.

*  Item. Categorical variable with the products.
